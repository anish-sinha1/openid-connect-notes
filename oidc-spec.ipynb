    "\n",
    "The OpenID Conenct 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based\n",
    "on the authentication performed by an Authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable\n",
    "and REST-like manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification defines the core OpenID Connect functionality: authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use of\n",
    "Claims to communicate information about the End-User. It also describes the security and privacy considerations for using OpenID Connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a background, the OAuth 2.0 Authorization framework and OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage specifications provide a general framework for third-party\n",
    "applications to obtain and use limited access to HTTP resources. They define mechanisms to obtain and use Access Tokens to access resources but do\n",
    "not define standard methods to provide identity information. Notably, without profiling OAuth 2.0, it is incapable of providing information about\n",
    "the authentication of an End-User. Readers are expected to be familiar with these specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the OAuth 2.0 authorization process. Use of this extension is requested by clients by\n",
    "including the `openid` scope value in the Authorization Request. Information about the authentication performed is returned in a JSON Web Token\n",
    "(JWT) called an ID Token. OAuth 2.0 Authentication Servers implementing OpenID Connect are also referred to as OpenID Providers (OPs). OAuth 2.0\n",
    "Clients using OpenID Connect are also referred to as Relying Parties (RPs). \n",
    "\n",
    "This specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained configuration information about the OpenID Provider, including its \n",
    "Authorization Endpoint and Token Endpoint locations. This information is normally obtained via Discovery, as described in OpenID Connect Discovery\n",
    "1.0, or may be obtained via other mechanisms. "

    "\n",
    "The primary extension that OpenID Connect makes to OAuth 2.0 to enable End-Users to be Authenticated is the ID Token data structure. The ID Token\n",
    "is a security token that contains Claims about the Authentication of the End-User by an Authorization Server when using a Client, and potentially\n",
    "other requested Claims. The ID Token is represented as a JSON Web Token (JWT).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Claims are used within the ID Token for all OAuth 2.0 flows used by OpenID Connect\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- iss: REQUIRED. Issuer Identifier for the Issuer of the response. The `iss` value is a case-sensitive URL using the https scheme that contains\n",
    "  scheme, host, and optionally, port number and path components and no query or fragment components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- sub: REQUIRED. Subject Identifier. A locally unique and never reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, which is intended to be\n",
    "  consumed by the Client, e.g. `235816350` or `ASga23y28ghv232`. It MUST NOT exceed 255 ASCII characters in length. The sub value is a case\n",
    "  sensitive string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- aud: REQUIRED. Audiences that this ID Token is intended for. It MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 client_id of the Relying Party as an audience value.\n",
    "  It MAY also contain identifiers for other audiences. In the general case, the aud value is an array of case sensitive strings. In the common\n",
    "  special case where there is one audience, the `aud` value MAY be a single, case sensitive string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- iat: REQUIRED. Time at which the JWT was issued. Its value is a JSON Number representing the number of seconds from `1970-01-01T0:0:0Z` as \n",
    "  measured in UTC until the date/time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- auth_time: Time when the End-User authentication occurred. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from \n",
    "  `1970-01-01T0:0:0Z` as measured in URC until the date/time. When a max_age request is made or when auth_time is requested as an Essential\n",
    "  Claim, then this Claim is REQUIRED; otherwise, its inclusion is OPTIONAL. (The `auth_time` Claim semantically corresponds to the OpenID 2.0\n",
    "  PAPE auth_time response parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "- nonce: String value used to associate a Client session with an ID Token, and to mitigate replay attacks. The value is passed through unmodified\n",
    "  from the Authentication Request to the ID Token. If present in the ID token, Clients MUST verify that the nonce Claim Value is equal to the \n",
    "  value of the nonce parameter sent in the Authentication Request. If present in the Authentication Request, Authorization Servers MUST include a\n",
    "  `nonce` claim in the ID Token with the Claim Value being the nonce value sent in the Authentication Request. Authorization Servers SHOULD'\n",
    "  perform no other processing on `nonce` values used. The `nonce` value is a case sensitive string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- acr: OPTIONAL. Authentication Context Class Reference. String specifying an Authentication Context Class Reference Value that identifies the\n",
    "  Authentication Context Class that the authentication performed satisfied. The value \"0\" indicates the End-User authentication did not meet the\n",
    "  requirements of ISO/IEC 29115 level 1. Authentication using a long-lived browser cookie, for instance, is once example where the use of \"level 0\"\n",
    "  is appropriate. Authentications with level 0 SHOULD NOT be used to authorize access to any resource of any monetary value. (This corresponds\n",
    "  to the OpenID 2.0 PAPE `nist_auth_level` 0). An absulte URI or a RFC6711 registered name Should be used as the `acr` value; registered names\n",
    "  MUST NOT be used with a different meaning than that which is registered. Parties using this claim will need to agree upon the meanings of the\n",
    "  values used, which may be context-specific. The `acr` value is a case sensitive string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- amr: OPTIONAL. Authentication Methods References. JSON array of strings that are identifiers for authentication methods used in the authentication.\n",
    "  For instance, values might indicate that both password and OTP authentication were used. The definition of particular values to be used in the\n",
    "  `amr` Claim is beyond the scope of this specification. Parties using this claim will need to agree upon the meaning of the values used, which \n",
    "  may be context specific. The `amr` value is an array of case-sensitive strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- azp: OPTIONAL. Authorized Party. The party to which the ID Token was issued. If present, it MUST contain the OAuth 2.0 Client ID of this party.\n",
    "  This Claim is only needed when the ID Token has a single audience value and that audience is different than the authorized party. It MAY be \n",
    "  included even when the authorized party is the same as the sole audience. The `azp` value is a case sensitive string containing a StringOrURI\n",
    "  value.\n",
